Welcome to the **Realtime Emotion Detector** repository! This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions captured through a webcam. It classifies these expressions into seven distinct emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model alongside OpenCV for real-time face detection, this system aims to provide a seamless experience in emotion recognition.

## Introduction

Understanding human emotions is crucial in various fields such as psychology, marketing, and human-computer interaction. The **Realtime Emotion Detector** offers a way to analyze facial expressions quickly and accurately. This project combines machine learning with computer vision to provide real-time feedback on emotional states.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Detects emotions in real-time using webcam input.
- **Multi-Emotion Classification**: Classifies expressions into seven categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to set up and use.
- **Open Source**: Available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time face detection and image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.

## Installation

To get started with the **Realtime Emotion Detector**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlthecoder123123/Realtime-emotion-detector.git
   cd Realtime-emotion-detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   You can download the pre-trained model from the [Releases section](https://github.com/carlthecoder123123/Realtime-emotion-detector/releases). Ensure to download and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

To run the emotion detector, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python emotion_detector.py
```

This will launch the webcam feed and start detecting emotions in real-time. 

## How It Works

The **Realtime Emotion Detector** works through the following steps:

1. **Face Detection**: OpenCV captures the video feed and detects faces in real-time.
2. **Preprocessing**: Detected faces are resized and normalized for the CNN model.
3. **Emotion Classification**: The CNN model predicts the emotion based on the processed face.
4. **Display Results**: The detected emotion is displayed on the screen.

### Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of several layers:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the features into the respective emotions.

### Training the Model

If you want to train your own model, you can use the training scripts provided in the `training` directory. Ensure you have a labeled dataset of facial expressions for effective training.
